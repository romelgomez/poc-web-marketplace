# we have meilisearch indexes, these indexes will work like this:

- when a new account is created, an index will be created to map all the publications of this account
- when a new profile is created, an index will be created to map all the publications of this profile of that account

we also have custom indexes, that will be used to map some specific stuff, like:

- all the publications of the accounts that have the custom "is-verified" for example
- all the publications of the accounts that have the custom "is-verified" and "is-featured" for example
- all the publications of the accounts that have the custom "is-verified" "is-featured" and "is-premium" for example and other combinations
- to support marketing campaigns, that will map the relevant publications
- to support A/B tests, that will map the relevant publications
- to support some specific searches, that will map the relevant publications
- to support closed groups, that will map the relevant publications
- to support test groups, that will map the relevant publications
- to support canary campaigns, that will map the relevant publications
- some of these index are public, some are private, and some for admins only
- some of these indexes will be created by the admin, some will be created by customers, and some will be created by the system
- these indexes will be market specific, if the account is from the market A, the index will be created in market A, if the account is from market B, the index will be created in market B, and so on
  each market will only load the indexes that are relevant to that market, so the indexes will be loaded dynamically, and the indexes will be created dynamically too

---

To resolve the TODO, which involves updating the entities to support search indexes with Meilisearch in a system using TypeORM and NestJS GraphQL, you need to integrate Meilisearch functionality into your existing entities. This integration involves creating dynamic indexes based on various conditions such as account creation, profile creation, and custom criteria like "is-verified", "is-featured", and "is-premium".

Here's a plan to implement the required functionality:

1. **Extend Entities for Search Indexing**: Modify the `Account`, `Profile`, and `Publication` entities to support indexing. This could be done by adding a method or property that returns the data in a format suitable for indexing.

2. **Create SearchIndex Entity**: This entity will represent a Meilisearch index. It could store information such as the name of the index, its type (public, private, admin), and which market it belongs to.

3. **Index Management Service**: Develop a service to handle the creation, updating, and deletion of indexes. This service will interact with Meilisearch and your database.

4. **Dynamic Index Creation**: Implement logic to dynamically create indexes when new accounts or profiles are created. This involves hooking into the creation processes of these entities and invoking the Index Management Service.

5. **Custom Indexes**: Develop a system to create custom indexes based on specific criteria like "is-verified", "is-featured", etc. This could involve querying your database for accounts or profiles that meet these criteria and then indexing their publications.

6. **Market-Specific Indexing**: Implement logic to ensure that indexes are created in the correct market. This could involve adding a "market" field to your entities and using this field to determine where to create the index.

7. **Dynamic Index Loading**: Develop a mechanism to load only the indexes relevant to a particular market. This might involve tagging each index with a market identifier and filtering based on this tag.

8. **Admin and User-Defined Indexes**: Allow admins and users to create custom indexes. This would require UI and backend support for specifying the criteria for these indexes.

9. **Indexing Publications**: Ensure that whenever a publication is created or updated, it is added to the correct indexes. This might involve extending the Publication entity or the service that manages publications.

10. **Search Functionality**: Finally, implement the search functionality using Meilisearch, allowing users to query the indexes based on their requirements.

Here's a basic implementation of the `SearchIndex` entity:

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, ManyToOne } from 'typeorm';
import { Field, ObjectType } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { BaseEntity } from '../base/base.entity';
import { Account } from '../accounts/account.entity';
import { Markets } from '../markets/markets.entity';

@Entity()
@ObjectType({ description: 'Search Index' })
export class SearchIndex extends BaseEntity {
  @Field({ nullable: false })
  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Field({ nullable: false })
  @Column()
  indexType: string; // e.g., 'public', 'private', 'admin'

  @Field(() => Account)
  @ManyToOne(() => Account, (account) => account.searchIndexes)
  account: Account;

  @Field(() => Markets)
  @ManyToOne(() => Markets, (market) => market.searchIndexes)
  market: Markets;
}
```

This approach provides a robust framework for managing Meilisearch indexes in a multi-market, multi-account environment, allowing for dynamic and customizable search functionalities.

To create a production-ready version of the `SearchIndex` entity, we need to enhance its structure and features to fully support dynamic and efficient indexing with Meilisearch. This includes adding more detailed fields, relationships, and methods for better integration with the rest of your application.

Here's an enhanced version of the `SearchIndex` entity:

```typescript
import {
  Entity,
  Column,
  ManyToOne,
  CreateDateColumn,
  UpdateDateColumn,
  Index,
} from 'typeorm';
import { Field, ObjectType, ID } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { BaseEntity } from '../base/base.entity';
import { Account } from '../accounts/account.entity';
import { Profile } from '../profiles/profile.entity';
import { Markets } from '../markets/markets.entity';

@Entity()
@ObjectType({ description: 'Search Index' })
export class SearchIndex extends BaseEntity {
  @Field(() => ID)
  id: string;

  @Field({ nullable: false })
  @Column()
  @Index() // Adding an index for faster queries on 'name'
  name: string;

  @Field({ nullable: false })
  @Column()
  indexType: string; // e.g., 'public', 'private', 'admin'

  @Field({ nullable: false })
  @Column({ type: 'jsonb', nullable: true })
  criteria: any; // Stores JSON criteria for custom indexing

  @Field(() => Account, { nullable: true })
  @ManyToOne(() => Account, (account) => account.searchIndexes, {
    nullable: true,
  })
  account: Account;

  @Field(() => Profile, { nullable: true })
  @ManyToOne(() => Profile, (profile) => profile.searchIndexes, {
    nullable: true,
  })
  profile: Profile;

  @Field(() => Markets)
  @ManyToOne(() => Markets, (market) => market.searchIndexes)
  market: Markets;

  @CreateDateColumn()
  createdAt: Date;

  @UpdateDateColumn()
  updatedAt: Date;

  // Method to handle index creation in Meilisearch
  async createIndex() {
    // Logic to create the index in Meilisearch
  }

  // Method to update the index settings in Meilisearch
  async updateIndexSettings() {
    // Logic to update index settings
  }

  // Method to delete the index from Meilisearch
  async deleteIndex() {
    // Logic to delete the index
  }
}
```

In this version:

- Added an `id` field as the primary key.
- Implemented `@Index()` on the `name` field for better performance.
- Added `criteria` field to store JSON criteria for custom indexing. This allows for more flexibility in defining what each index should contain.
- Included optional relationships to `Account` and `Profile` entities. This allows linking indexes to specific accounts or profiles, supporting the use-case where indexes are created for individual accounts or profiles.
- Added `market` relationship to link each index to a specific market.
- Included `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to track the creation and last update times of each index.
- Added methods like `createIndex`, `updateIndexSettings`, and `deleteIndex` as placeholders for the actual logic that interacts with Meilisearch. These methods are essential for managing the lifecycle of indexes in your application.

This version of the `SearchIndex` entity is more comprehensive and is designed to integrate seamlessly with Meilisearch and the rest of your application, providing a solid foundation for building a powerful search functionality.

Certainly! The `criteria` field in the `SearchIndex` entity plays a crucial role in defining the specific conditions or attributes that determine what data is included in a particular search index. This field is designed to be highly flexible and customizable, allowing for a wide range of search functionalities tailored to different needs. Here's a more detailed explanation of how the `criteria` field can be utilized:

### Structure and Format

- **JSONB Format**: The `criteria` field is stored in a JSONB format, which allows for storing structured, queryable JSON objects. This format is versatile and supports complex data structures.
- **Dynamic Criteria Definition**: The field can include various parameters like tags, account/profile attributes, publication properties, etc., to define what should be indexed.

### Examples of Criteria Usage

1. **Tag-Based Indexing**:

   - For instance, you might have criteria that specify indexing all publications with a specific tag like `"is-verified"`.
   - Example Criteria: `{"tags": ["is-verified"]}`

2. **Attribute-Based Indexing**:

   - You can index publications based on certain attributes of accounts or profiles, like `"is-premium"`.
   - Example Criteria: `{"accountAttributes": ["is-premium"]}`

3. **Combination of Conditions**:

   - Combine multiple conditions, such as indexing publications from verified, featured, and premium accounts.
   - Example Criteria: `{"tags": ["is-verified", "is-featured"], "accountAttributes": ["is-premium"]}`

4. **Market-Specific Indexing**:

   - Criteria can specify that only publications from a certain market are to be indexed.
   - Example Criteria: `{"market": "market-A"}`

5. **Campaign-Specific Indexing**:

   - For marketing campaigns, index publications related to a specific campaign.
   - Example Criteria: `{"campaign": "summer-sale-2023"}`

6. **User-Defined Criteria**:
   - Allow users or admins to create custom indexes by specifying their own criteria.
   - Example Criteria: `{"custom": "user-defined-criteria"}`

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Criteria Parsing and Processing**:

   - When indexing publications, parse the `criteria` JSON to determine which publications meet the conditions.
   - Implement a service or function to evaluate whether a publication matches the criteria.

2. **Dynamic Index Update**:

   - When a publication, account, or profile is updated, re-evaluate the criteria to decide if it should be added or removed from the index.

3. **Index Creation and Maintenance**:

   - During index creation, use the criteria to fetch initial data to populate the index.
   - Regularly update the index based on changes in publications, accounts, or profiles that affect the criteria.

4. **User Interface for Criteria Definition**:

   - If allowing users to define custom criteria, provide a user-friendly interface for creating and editing these criteria.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Since evaluating complex criteria against large datasets can be resource-intensive, optimize queries and indexing strategies for performance.

By leveraging the `criteria` field, the `SearchIndex` entity becomes a powerful tool for creating diverse and dynamic search indexes, catering to a multitude of search requirements and enhancing the overall search functionality of your application.

Certainly! Enhancing the `SearchIndex` entity further involves adding more functionalities and refinements to cater to a wide range of scenarios and making it more robust and scalable. Here's an improved version with additional features and considerations:

### Extended `SearchIndex` Entity

```typescript
import {
  Entity,
  Column,
  ManyToOne,
  CreateDateColumn,
  UpdateDateColumn,
  Index,
  BeforeInsert,
  BeforeUpdate,
} from 'typeorm';
import { Field, ObjectType, ID } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { BaseEntity } from '../base/base.entity';
import { Account } from '../accounts/account.entity';
import { Profile } from '../profiles/profile.entity';
import { Markets } from '../markets/markets.entity';
import { validateOrReject } from 'class-validator';

@Entity()
@ObjectType({ description: 'Search Index' })
export class SearchIndex extends BaseEntity {
  @Field(() => ID)
  id: string;

  @Field({ nullable: false })
  @Column()
  @Index() // Adding an index for faster queries on 'name'
  name: string;

  @Field({ nullable: false })
  @Column()
  indexType: string; // e.g., 'public', 'private', 'admin'

  @Field({ nullable: false })
  @Column({ type: 'jsonb', nullable: true })
  criteria: any; // Stores JSON criteria for custom indexing

  @Field(() => Account, { nullable: true })
  @ManyToOne(() => Account, (account) => account.searchIndexes, {
    nullable: true,
  })
  account: Account;

  @Field(() => Profile, { nullable: true })
  @ManyToOne(() => Profile, (profile) => profile.searchIndexes, {
    nullable: true,
  })
  profile: Profile;

  @Field(() => Markets)
  @ManyToOne(() => Markets, (market) => market.searchIndexes)
  market: Markets;

  @CreateDateColumn()
  createdAt: Date;

  @UpdateDateColumn()
  updatedAt: Date;

  // Adding validation before insert and update
  @BeforeInsert()
  @BeforeUpdate()
  async validate() {
    await validateOrReject(this);
  }

  // Method to handle index creation in Meilisearch
  async createIndex() {
    // Logic to create the index in Meilisearch
  }

  // Method to update the index settings in Meilisearch
  async updateIndexSettings() {
    // Logic to update index settings
  }

  // Method to delete the index from Meilisearch
  async deleteIndex() {
    // Logic to delete the index
  }

  // Additional method to validate and parse criteria
  parseCriteria() {
    // Logic to parse and validate criteria, ensuring it's in the correct format
  }
}
```

### Enhancements and Considerations

1. **Criteria Validation and Parsing**:

   - Implement a `parseCriteria` method that validates and parses the criteria to ensure it is in a correct and usable format.

2. **Entity Validation**:

   - Use `class-validator` to add validation rules ensuring that the entity's fields meet certain criteria before being inserted or updated in the database.

3. **Index Lifecycle Management**:

   - Expand the index management methods (`createIndex`, `updateIndexSettings`, `deleteIndex`) to handle more complex scenarios, such as reindexing when criteria change.

4. **Audit Trail**:

   - Consider maintaining an audit trail for changes to the search indexes, which can be crucial for debugging and understanding the evolution of indexes over time.

5. **Scalability and Performance**:

   - Optimize the entity for scalability. This could include strategies for handling large datasets, such as pagination in index creation and updates.

6. **Error Handling**:

   - Implement robust error handling in all methods interacting with Meilisearch to gracefully handle failures or unexpected scenarios.

7. **Security and Access Control**:

   - Implement security measures to control who can create, modify, or delete indexes, especially for indexes containing sensitive data.

8. **Automated Testing**:

   - Develop automated tests for this entity to ensure its reliability and to prevent regressions in future changes.

9. **Documentation and Comments**:

   - Add detailed comments and documentation for each field and method, explaining their purpose and usage. This is especially important for complex entities like this.

10. **Event Hooks**:
    - Consider implementing event hooks in other parts of your application that trigger index updates. For example, when a new publication is added, it should automatically be considered for inclusion in relevant indexes based on the criteria.

By incorporating these improvements, the `SearchIndex` entity becomes more robust, scalable, and capable of handling a wide array of search indexing scenarios in a production environment.
